            Overview. Arbitration is an alternative to litigation where a
            neutral person (the “Arbitrator”) hears and decides the parties’
            dispute. Arbitration proceedings are designed to provide parties
            with a fair hearing in a manner that is faster and less formal than
            court proceedings. The following procedures (the “Arbitration
            Procedures”) are applicable to all arbitration proceedings involving
            you and DG Auto.

            Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution. DG Auto is always interested in
            resolving disputes amicably and efficiently. So before you commence
            an arbitration, we suggest that you contact us to explain your
            complaint, as we may be able to resolve it without the need for
            arbitration. You may contact us at DG Legal, 527 Okerson Road,
            Freehold, NJ 07728.

        <ol class="special">
          <span>3</span>
          <li>
            Administrator. The administrator for the arbitration is JAMS, an
            organization that is not affiliated with DG Auto. The JAMS
            facilitates, but does not itself conduct, the arbitration. The
            arbitrator who will hear and decide your dispute will be chosen from
            the JAMS’s roster of neutral arbitrators. For information on the
            JAMS, please visit its website,
            <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com">https://www.jamsadr.com</a>.
            Information about JAMS’s rules and fees for resolving disputes can
            be found at JAMS’s Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures page,
            <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/"
              >https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a
            >.

        <ol class="special">
          <span>4</span>
          <li>
            Applicable Rules. The arbitration will be governed by JAMS’s
            Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures (the JAMS Rules”), as
            modified by these Arbitration Procedures. If there is any
            inconsistency between the JAMS Rules and these Arbitration
            Procedures, the Arbitration Procedures will control. However, if the
            Arbitrator determines that strict application of any term of the
            Arbitration Procedures would result in a fundamentally unfair
            arbitration (the “Unfair Term”), then the Arbitrator shall have
            authority to modify the Unfair Term to the extent necessary to
            ensure a fundamentally fair arbitration that is consistent with
            these Arbitration Procedures (the “Modified Term”). In determining
            the substance of a Modified Term, the Arbitrator shall select a term
            that comes closest to expressing the intention of the Unfair Term.

            Commencing an Arbitration. To commence an arbitration against DG
            Auto, you must complete a short form, submit it to JAMS, and send a
            copy to DG at DG Legal, 527 Okerson Road, Freehold, NJ 07728. To
            learn more about commencing an arbitration and to obtain a form to
            institute arbitration, please visit the JAMS website and download
            the form available at,
            <a
              href="https://www.jamsadr.com/files/Uploads/Documents/JAMS_Arbitration_Demand.pdf"

            >
            You may represent yourself in the arbitration or have a lawyer (or
            some other representative) act on your behalf. Upon receipt of an
            arbitration claim, DG Auto may assert any counterclaims it may have
            against the complaining party.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <ol class="special">
          <span>6</span>
          <li>
            Fees. You are responsible for paying your portion of the fees set
            forth in the JAMS fee schedule for consumer disputes. DG Auto will
            pay all remaining fees, except to the extent that fees paid by
            either party may be re-allocated upon order of the Arbitrator
            following a determination (a) that other party’s claim or
            counterclaim was filed for purposes of harassment or was frivolous,
            (b) that the other party engaged in any activities during the course
            of the arbitration for the purposes of harassment or to cause
            unnecessary costs or delay, or (c) that re-allocation is permitted
            by applicable law. If your claim against DG Auto is for less than
            $1,000 and you succeed on the merits, we will pay all fees, subject
            to the potential re-allocation discussed in the prior sentence. If
            you believe you cannot afford the JAMS fee, you may apply to JAMS
            for a fee waiver.

        <ol class="special">
          <span>7</span>
          <li>
            Discovery. Each party may (a) request relevant, non-privileged
            documents from the other party; and (b) request that the other party
            provide the particulars of its claims or responses to no more than 5
            relevant interrogatories (including subparts). Any such discovery
            requests must be served on the other party within 10 days after the
            Arbitrator’s appointment. The responding party shall provide the
            requesting party with all responsive, non-privileged documents,
            responses to the requested interrogatories, and/or any objections to
            the requests within 30 days after receipt of the requests. In the
            event of an objection to any discovery request, the objecting party
            shall not be required to provide any documents or interrogatory
            responses within the scope of the objection until the later of (a)
            30 days after the Arbitrator resolves the dispute or (b) a deadline
            for production determined by the Arbitrator. In the event either
            party requests that the Arbitrator consider a dispositive motion
            prior to the expiration of a response deadline set forth in this
            paragraph, such response deadline shall be extended until 30 days
            following (a) the Arbitrator’s decision on the request to hear the
            dispositive motion or (b) if the Arbitrator grants the request to
            hear the dispositive motion, the Arbitrator’s final decision on such
            dispositive motion. Depositions shall not be permitted, unless
            agreed to by both parties. Any disputes about discovery or requests
            for extensions shall be submitted promptly to the Arbitrator for
            prompt resolution. In ruling on any discovery dispute or extension
            request, the Arbitrator shall take into consideration the nature,
            amount, and scope of the underlying arbitration claim, the cost and
            other effort that would be involved in providing the requested
            discovery, the case schedule, and whether the requested discovery is
            necessary for the adequate preparation of a claim or defense.

        <ol class="special">
          <span>8</span>
          <li>
            Communications with the Arbitrator. Whenever communicating with the
            Arbitrator, the parties must include each other – for example, by
            including the other party on a telephone conference call and copying
            the other party on any written submissions, such as letters or
            emails. To the extent practicable, conferences with the Arbitrator
            will take place by telephone conference call or email. Ex parte
            communications are not permitted with the Arbitrator.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <ol class="special">
          <span>9</span>
          <li>
            Confidentiality. Upon either party’s request, the Arbitrator will
            issue an order requiring that confidential information of either
            party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or
            orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the
            arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and
            that any permitted filing of confidential information must be done
            under seal.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <ol class="special">
          <span>10</span>
          <li>
            Arbitration Hearing. The Parties agree to waive an oral hearing and
            submit the dispute to the Arbitrator for an Award based on written
            submissions and other evidence as the Parties may agree, unless a
            party requests an oral Hearing in writing within 10 days after the
            Arbitrator’s appointment. The Parties agree that the Arbitrator
            shall have the authority to consider dispositive motions without an
            oral evidentiary hearing if it determines that the motion is likely
            to succeed and will dispose of or narrow the issues in the case.
            Dispositive motions may be requested under the following
            circumstances: (a) within 30 days after the Arbitrator’s
            appointment, a party may request to file a dispositive motion based
            upon the pleadings; and (b) no later than 30 days prior to the oral
            evidentiary hearing, a party may request to file a dispositive
            motion for summary judgment based upon the parties’ pleadings and
            the evidence submitted.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <ol class="special">
          <span>11</span>
          <li>
            Arbitration Award. The Arbitrator will render a written decision
            within 30 days after the hearing or, if no hearing was held, within
            30 days after any rebuttal or supplemental statements are due. The
            decision must clearly specify the relief, if any, awarded and
            contain a brief statement of the reasons for the award.
