            interact with the Services over time. This information may be used
            to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the
            popularity of certain content and better understand online activity.
            Unless described in this Policy, we do not share, sell, rent or
            trade any of your information with third parties for their
            promotional purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Business Transfers. </strong>

        <p>
          We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons
          and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about
          how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is
          set out in our Cookie Policy.

          <span>5</span>
          <li>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          <strong>In Short:</strong>&nbsp; We keep your information for as long
          as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice
          unless otherwise required by law.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
          necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
          longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
          accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy
          will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 1
          year.
        </p>

        <p>
          When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
          personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if
          this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
          has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your
          personal information and isolate it from any further processing until
          deletion is possible.

          <strong>In Short:</strong> &nbsp; We aim to protect your personal
          information through a system of organizational and technical security
          measures.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
          measures designed to protect the security of any personal information
          we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee
          that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best
          to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
          information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should
          only access the services within a secure environment.

          been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
          measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become
          aware of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please

        <p>
          <strong>In Short: </strong>&nbsp; In some regions, such as the

        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can
          activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
          online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform
          technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
          been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
          signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
          choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
          adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about
          that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
