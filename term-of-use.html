        <p>
          By creating a DG Auto account or by using any DG Auto service, whether
          through a mobile device, mobile application or computer (collectively,
          the “Service”) you agree to be bound by (i) these Terms of Use, (ii)
          our <a href="privacy-notice.html">Privacy Policy</a>,
          <a href="cookie-policy.html">Cookie Policy</a>,
          <a href="arbitration-procedures.html">Arbitration Procedures</a>, and
          <a href="community-guidelines.html">Community Guidelines</a>, each of
          which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement, and (iii) any
          terms disclosed to you if you purchase or have purchased additional
          features, products or services we offer on the Service (collectively,
          this “Agreement”). If you do not accept and agree to be bound by all
          of the terms of this Agreement (other than the limited one-time
          opt-out right for certain members provided for in Section 15), you
          should not use the Service.
        </p>

        <p>
          should not use the Service. We may make changes to this Agreement and
          to the Service from time to time. We may do this for a variety of
          reasons including to reflect changes in or requirements of the law,
          new features, or changes in business practices. The most recent
          version of this Agreement will be posted on the Service under Settings
          and also on go DG Auto.com, and you should regularly check for the
          most recent version. The most recent version is the version that
          applies. If the changes include material changes to your rights or
          obligations, we will notify you in advance of the changes (unless
          we’re unable to do so under applicable law) by reasonable means, which
          could include notification through the Service or via email. If you
          continue to use the Service after the changes become effective, then
          you agree to the revised Agreement. You agree that this Agreement
          shall supersede any prior agreements (except as specifically stated
          herein), and shall govern your entire relationship with DG Auto,
          including but not limited to events, agreements, and conduct preceding
          your acceptance of this Agreement.

        <p>
          DG Auto is always striving to improve the Service and bring you
          additional functionality that you will find engaging and useful. This
          means we may add new product features or enhancements from time to
          time as well as remove some features, and if these actions do not
          materially affect your rights or obligations, we may not provide you
          with notice before taking them. We may even suspend the Service
          entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance unless
          extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns,
          prevent us from doing so.

          believes that you have violated this Agreement. Upon such termination,
          you will not be entitled to any refund for purchases. After your
          account is terminated, this Agreement will terminate, except that the
          following provisions will still apply to you and DG Auto: Section 4,
          Section 5, and Sections 12 through 19.

          including termination of your account.
        </p>

        <p>
          Any software that we provide you may automatically download and

        <ol>
          <span>7.</span>
          <li>Rights you Grant DG Auto.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          By creating an account, you grant to DG Auto a worldwide,
          transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, right and license to host,
          store, use, copy, display, reproduce, adapt, edit, publish, modify and
          distribute information you authorize us to access as well as any
          information you upload, display or otherwise make available
          (collectively, “post”) on the Service or transmit to DG Auto
          administrators or other members (collectively, “Content”). DG Auto’s
          license to your Content shall be non-exclusive, except that DG Auto’s
          license shall be exclusive with respect to derivative works created
          through use of the Service. For example, DG Auto would have an
          exclusive license to screenshots of the Service that include your
          Content. In addition, so that DG Auto can prevent the use of your
          Content outside of the Service, you authorize DG Auto to act on your
          behalf with respect to infringing uses of your Content taken from the
          Service by other members or third parties. This expressly includes the
          authority, but not the obligation, to send notices pursuant to 17
          U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e., DMCA Takedown Notices) on your behalf if
          your Content is taken and used by third parties outside of the
          Service. Our license to your Content is subject to your rights under
          applicable law (for example laws regarding personal data protection to
          the extent any Content contains personal information as defined by
          those laws) and is for the limited purpose of operating, developing,
          providing, and improving the Service and researching and developing
          new ones. You agree that any Content you place or that you authorize
          us to place on the Service may be viewed by other members and may be
          viewed by any person visiting or participating in the Service (such as
          individuals who may receive shared Content from other DG Auto
          members).
        </p>

        <p>
          You agree that all information that you submit upon creation of your
          account is accurate and truthful and you have the right to post the
          Content on the Service and grant the license to DG Auto above.
        </p>

        <p>
          You understand and agree that we may monitor or review any Content you
          post as part of a Service. We may delete any Content, in whole or in
          part, that in our sole judgment violates this Agreement or may harm
          the reputation of the Service.
        </p>

        <p>
          When communicating with our customer care representatives, you agree
          to be respectful and kind. If we feel that your behavior towards any
          of our customer care representatives or other employees is at any time
          threatening, harassing, or offensive, we reserve the right to
          immediately terminate your account.
        </p>

        <p>
          In consideration for DG Auto allowing you to use the Service, you
          agree that we, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place
          advertising on the Service. By submitting suggestions or feedback to
          DG Auto regarding our Service, you agree that DG Auto may use and
          share such feedback for any purpose without compensating you.
        </p>

        <p>
          You agree that DG Auto may access, preserve and disclose your account
          information and Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith
          belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably
          necessary, such as to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce
          this Agreement; (iii) respond to claims that any Content violates the
          rights of third parties; (iv) respond to your requests for customer
          service; or (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety of the
          Company or any other person.

          <li>Purchases</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          <strong>Generally.</strong> From time to time, DG Auto may offer
          products and services for purchase (“in app purchases”) through DG
          Auto direct billing or other payment platforms authorized by DG Auto.
          If you choose to make an in app purchase, you will be prompted to
          confirm your purchase with the applicable payment provider, and your
          method of payment (your “Payment Method”) will be charged at the
          prices displayed to you for the service(s) you’ve selected as well as
          any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on your payments, and
          you authorize DG Auto or the third party account, as applicable, to
          charge you.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Auto-Renewal.</strong> If you purchase an auto-recurring
          periodic subscription, your Payment Method will continue to be billed
          for the subscription until you cancel. After your initial subscription
          commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period,
          your subscription will automatically continue for an additional
          equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing.
          <strong
            >If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if
            you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to
            access your third party account (or Account Settings on DG Auto, if
            applicable) and follow the instructions to cancel your subscription,
            even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or deleted
            the DG Auto application from your device.</strong
          >
          Deleting your account on DG Auto or deleting the DG Auto application
          from your device does not cancel your subscription; DG Auto will
          retain all funds charged to your Payment Method until you cancel your
          subscription on DG Auto or the third party account, as applicable. If
          you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the
          end of your then-current subscription term, and your subscription will
          not be renewed after your then-current term expires.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >Additional Terms that apply if you pay DG Auto directly with your
            Payment Method.</strong
          >If you pay DG Auto directly, DG Auto may correct any billing errors
          or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received
          payment. If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment
          made with your Payment Method, DG Auto may terminate your account
          immediately in its sole discretion.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting DG Auto and
          going to Settings. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to
          expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your
          Payment Method information or cancel your subscription, you remain
          responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue
          billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a
          change to your payment billing dates. In addition, you authorize us to
          obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for
          your credit or debit card as provided by your credit or debit card
          issuer. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method
          and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial
          institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen
          Payment Method. If you reside outside of the Americas, you agree that
          your payment to DG Auto will be through MTCH Technology Services
          Limited.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Refunds.</strong> Generally, all charges for purchases are
          nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used
          periods. We may make an exception if a refund for a subscription
          offering is requested within fourteen days of the transaction date, or
          if the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds.

          For subscribers residing in Arizona, California, Connecticut,

          Wisconsin, the terms below apply:
        </p>

        <p>
          You may cancel your subscription, without penalty or obligation, at
          any time prior to midnight of the third business day following the
          date you subscribed. In the event that you die before the end of your
          subscription period, your estate shall be entitled to a refund of that
          portion of any payment you had made for your subscription which is
          allocable to the period after your death. In the event that you become
          disabled (such that you are unable to use the services of DG Auto)
          before the end of your subscription period, you shall be entitled to a
          refund of that portion of any payment you had made for your
          subscription which is allocable to the period after your disability by
          providing the company notice in the same manner as you request a
          refund as described below.

          <strong>Pricing.</strong>DG Auto operates a global business, and our
          pricing varies by a number of factors. We frequently offer promotional
          rates – which can vary based on region, length of subscription, bundle
          size and more. We also regularly test new features and payment
          options.

            ARBITRATION administered by JAMS under the JAMS Streamlined
            Arbitration Rules & Procedures, except as modified by our
            Arbitration Procedures. The one exception to the exclusivity of
            arbitration is that either party has the right to bring an
            individual claim against the other in a small claims court of
            competent jurisdiction, or, if filed in arbitration, the responding
            party may request that the dispute proceed in small claims court
            instead if the claim is within the jurisdiction of the small claims
            court. If the request to proceed in small claims court is made
            before an arbitrator has been appointed, the arbitration shall be
            administratively closed. If the request to proceed in small claims
            court is made after an arbitrator has been appointed, the arbitrator
            shall determine whether the dispute should remain in arbitration or
            instead be decided in small claims court. Such arbitration shall be
            conducted by written submissions only, unless either you or DG Auto
            elect to invoke the right to an oral hearing before the Arbitrator.
            But whether you choose arbitration or small claims court, you agree
            that you will not under any circumstances commence, maintain, or
            participate in any class action, class arbitration, or other
            representative action or proceeding against DG Auto.

            within thirty (30) days belonging to members who first created an
            account or used the Service prior to May 9, 2018 (such members,
            “Legacy Members”), discussed below). In doing so, BOTH YOU AND DG
            AUTO GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims
            between you and DG Auto (except for matters that may be properly
            taken to a small claims court and are within such court’s
            jurisdiction). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS
            ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING, including, without limitation, any
            past, pending or future class actions, including those existing as

            If you assert a claim against DG Auto outside of small claims court
            (and DG Auto does not request that the claim be moved to small
            claims court), your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL
            ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY, and the arbitrator shall determine
            all claims and all issues regarding the arbitrability of the
            dispute. The same is true for DG Auto. Both you and DG Auto are
            entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can
            generally grant the relief that a court can, including the ability
            to hear a dispositive motion (which may include a dispositive motion
            based upon the parties’ pleadings, as well as a dispositive motion
            based upon the parties’ pleadings along with the evidence
            submitted), but you should note that arbitration proceedings are
            usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial
            proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court
            and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For
            details on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures.

          As you decide whether to agree to this Arbitration Agreement, here are
          some important considerations:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Arbitration is a process of private dispute resolution that does not
            involve the civil courts, a civil judge or a jury. Instead, the
            parties’ dispute is decided by a private arbitrator selected by the
            parties under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp;
            Procedures. Arbitration does not limit or affect the legal claims
            you as an individual may bring against DG Auto. Agreeing to
            arbitration will only affect where those claims may be brought and
            how they will be resolved.
          </li>
          <li>
            Arbitration is generally considered to be a more rapid dispute
            resolution process than the judicial system, but that is not always
            the case. The Arbitrator will typically determine whether DG Auto or
            you will be required to pay or split the cost of any arbitration
            with DG Auto, based on the circumstances presented.
          </li>

            15, WHICH IF SUCCESSFUL, COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN SOME MONETARY
            OR OTHER RECOVERY TO YOU, IF YOU ELECT TO OPT OUT OF THE RETROACTIVE
            APPLICATION OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THE MERE EXISTENCE OF
            SUCH CLASS AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUITS, HOWEVER, DOES NOT MEAN
            THAT SUCH LAWSUITS WILL ULTIMATELY SUCCEED, OR, EVEN IF SUCCESSFUL,
            THAT YOU WOULD BE ENTITLED TO ANY RECOVERY.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will be precluded from bringing any class or representative
            action against DG Auto, unless you timely opt out of the retroactive
            application of this Arbitration Agreement, and you will also be
            precluded from participating in any recovery resulting from any
            class or representative action brought against DG Auto, in each case
            provided you are not already bound by an arbitration agreement and
            class action waiver previously agreed to with DG Auto.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          WHETHER TO AGREE TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS AN IMPORTANT
          DECISION. IT IS YOUR DECISION TO MAKE, AND YOU SHOULD TAKE CARE TO
          CONDUCT FURTHER RESEARCH AND TO CONSULT WITH OTHERS — INCLUDING BUT
          NOT LIMITED TO AN ATTORNEY — REGARDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR
          DECISION, JUST AS YOU WOULD WHEN MAKING ANY OTHER IMPORTANT BUSINESS
          OR LIFE DECISION.
        </p>

        <p>
          IF FOR ANY REASON THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO BE INVALID,
          YOU WILL NEVERTHELESS STILL BE BOUND BY ANY PRIOR VALID ARBITRATION
          AGREEMENT THAT YOU ENTERED INTO WITH DG AUTO.

          Except where our arbitration agreement is prohibited by law, the laws
          of New Jersey, U.S.A., without regard to its conflict of laws rules,
          shall apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to this
          Agreement, the Service, or your relationship with DG Auto.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Arbitration Agreement in Section 15
          above shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.

        <p>
          Except for claims that may be properly brought in a small claims court
          of competent jurisdiction, all claims arising out of or relating to
          this Agreement, to the Service, or to your relationship with DG Auto
          that for whatever reason are not submitted to arbitration will be
          litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Monmouth
          County, New Jersey, U.S.A. You and DG Auto consent to the exercise of
          personal jurisdiction of courts in the State of New Jersey and waive
          any claim that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.

          relationship with DG Auto and the use of the Service, with the
          following exception: anyone who opted out of the retroactive
          application of Section 15 is still subject to and bound by any prior
          agreements to arbitrate with DG Auto as well as this agreement to
          arbitrate on a going forward basis. If any provision of this Agreement
          is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in
          full force and effect. The failure of DG Auto to exercise or enforce
          any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver
          of such right or provision. You agree that your DG Auto account is
          non-transferable and all of your rights to your account and its
          Content terminate upon your death. No agency, partnership, joint
